This project was built from scratch and meets all the technical requirements of the assignment.

2.1 HTML & Structure

Semantic HTML5: Uses <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <figure>, <figcaption>, and <footer> correctly across all pages for improved accessibility and SEO.

Media: Includes 5+ optimized images (using assets/img/ local paths) with descriptive alt text.

iframe: Features a responsive Google Maps iframe on the location.html page.

Navigation: A consistent navigation bar is present on all 7 pages, with the active page highlighted. Includes both internal links (to other pages) and an external link (to Google).

2.2 Full-Featured Form (booking.html)

The booking page features a comprehensive form demonstrating all required HTML5 inputs:

Structure: Uses <fieldset> and <legend> to group controls, with a <label> for every input.

Input Types: Includes text, email, tel, password, number, date, range, color, and file.

Selectors: Includes radio buttons, checkboxes, a <select> dropdown with <optgroup>, and a <datalist> for suggestions.

Other Elements: Uses a <textarea> for special requests and submit/reset buttons.

Validation: Employs required, pattern (for phone number), and min/max attributes.

2.3 CSS & Styling

External CSS: All styles are contained in a single assets/css/styles.css file, linked to all HTML pages.

CSS Variables: Uses CSS Variables (:root) for a consistent color scheme and typography, making the site easy to re-brand.

Responsive Layout: The site is fully responsive, using Flexbox (for page sections) and CSS Grid (for the menu and gallery).

Media Query: A breakpoint at 768px ensures the layout stacks correctly on mobile devices, including the navigation bar.

User Experience: Includes hover and focus states for all links and form elements to improve usability and accessibility.

2.4 Accessibility & Optimization
